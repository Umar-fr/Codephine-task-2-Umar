# 2. RANDOM PASSWORD GENERATOR
I will be Creating a command-line password generator in Python that generates random passwords based on user-defined criteria, such as length and character types (letters, numbers, symbols). Allowing users to specify password length and character set preferences.
-> Key Concepts and Challenges:
. Randomization: Learn how to generate random characters and strings.
. User Input Validation: Validate user input for password length and character types.
. Character Set Handling: Manage different character sets (letters, numbers, symbols).
. GUI Design (for Advanced): Create an intuitive and user-friendly interface for password generation.
. Security Rules (for Advanced): Implement rules for generating strong, secure passwords.
. Clipboard Integration (for Advanced): Allow users to copy generated passwords to the clipboard for convenience.
. Customization (for Advanced): Enable users to customize password generation further, e.g., excluding specific characters.
